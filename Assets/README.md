# Weather_Dash


Created a weather dashboard that currently stores the Variables for the city typed in
and generates the current weather and displays it. Still trying to get the 5-day forecast to populate.
Can't figure out how to set array to the local store so that it saves.

Should of broken it up into more functions, adding new elemenents causes failure.
